fact: "Using finite-difference time-domain and finite element methods, we performed in-depth evaluation of the extinction spectra and electric field distribution in a tetrahelix nanostructure and its dependence on various geometric parameters. The reported structure supports various plasmonic modes, one of which shows a strong incident light handedness selectivity that is associated with large face-to-face junctions."
