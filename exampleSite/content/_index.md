I am an undergraduate student majoring in Nanotechnology Engineering at the University of Waterloo, Canada. I have ~2 years of research experience from working in universities around the world, and with people from Google.

I am always on the lookout for internships, so feel free to send me an email if you are looking for a hard-working and innovative intern!
